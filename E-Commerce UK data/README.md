### Background of the data

- transactions (orders and cancelations) from mostly wholesalers on a UK online retail store
- online purchases only
- period of transactions: 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011
- around 540,000 data points, most of them relate to UK customers

The data set originally comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, where is is maintained and accessible by the "Online Retail". I accessed the data set in July 2020 from the following repository on kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data


## Objectives

The aim of this notebook is to investigate on the purchasing habits that customers from different countries followed when they did the purchased contained in this data set.
To do so, the purchases are grouped in seasonal sections and analyzed per country. Based on the product bought, its price, and its quantity findings can be obtained and analyzed. A further variable 'Price_total', which I created myself, is taken into consideration here.
For the analysis I mainly focus on comparative visualizations.
