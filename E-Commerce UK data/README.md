### Background of the data

- transactions (orders and cancelations) from mostly wholesalers on a UK online retail store
- online purchases only
- period of transactions: 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011
- around 540,000 data points, most of them relate to UK customers
- retail shop mainly sells all-occasion presents

The data set originally comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, where it is maintained and accessible by the "Online Retail". I accessed the data set in July 2020 from the following repository on kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data


## Objectives

This project I mainly undertook to apply data cleaning and visualization techniques in the e-Commerce sector (an area of main personal interest to me). In particular, my aim of this notebook was to obtain insights on who the customers of the seller were, where they come from, and what products were popular at what period of the year.
Based on the product bought, its price, and its quantity findings could be obtained and analyzed. A further variable 'Price_total', added by me, was taken into consideration here. For the analysis, I mainly focussed on comparative visualizations.
