This dataset deals with pollution in the U.S. It contains daily data for the four major pollutants NO2, O3, SO2 and CO during 2000 and 2010.
The data set comes with 28 variables (among which each of the four pollutations represents five columns) and more than one million observations.

The source of this data set is https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution. The original data was scraped from the database of U.S. EPA : https://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html

This notebook mainly deals with pollution in the state California, since it by far has the most data points. The focus of this work is on 
data cleaning and visualization.

Main content:

- Data exploration and cleaning
