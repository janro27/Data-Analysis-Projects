- This repository is used to store, keep track of, and share all my Data-Analysis projects. 
- All projects deal with the cleaning, structuring, visualization and analysis of the related data set. 
- Some projects focus on the cleaning part, some on the visualization etc. The particular focus can be seen in each project's subfolder.
- I mainly work with Jupyter notebook/lab and code in Python.

For any sort of comment or inquiry please feel free to contact me.
